## Redoing Continuos sensing phase

TODO: Remove null and pilot carriers.

1- Create model function of equation (1) at IV-A (page 4).

2- Denoise aCSI
    - denoise aCSI per subcarrier using the wavelet method
    - remove outliers by only including subcarriers whose σ aCSI (·) sequences are highly correlated.

3- Think about implementation of sensing ambiguity algorithm
